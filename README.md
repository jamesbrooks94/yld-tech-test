# YLD Lazy technical challenge - James Brooks

## Instructions

To run the application, clone the repository, cd to the directory, and run yarn install.  
Following this, simply run `yarn test` which will start the test runner and output coverage.  
Running `yarn test:watch` will run the tests in watch mode.

I would have loved to have used TypeScript with this, however I have limited time at the moment.
